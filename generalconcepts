CA -> issues digital certificates

digital certificates -> contains public key and identity of the owner

so the above public key is made public whereas the matching private key will be kept secret

this public and private key should be generated by the end user and private key will be kept secret

the CA vouch that the public key provided in the certificate is belong to that person or identity

CAs uses variety of standards and tests to verify the applicants credentials

CA verdict should be like this -> yes.. this person says who he is ..

Two Tier Hierarchy  ( one root ca offline and 2 issuing ca )
Three Tier Hierarchy ( root -> policy ca -> issuing ca )

Obtain a Certificate:

1. generate keypair and csr -> send to issuing CA for certificate -> 
2. csr contains public key which will be in a format which ca normally accepts
3. you will get the certificates / the # of certificates depends on CAs hierarchical structure.
